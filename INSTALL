Use the typical procedure for compiling kde apps using cmake:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make (ignore warnings about unknown escape sequence, if any)
sudo make install

WHAT YOU'LL NEED

cmake >= 2.8.12
with cmake extra modules
KDE-FRAMEWORK KF5 >= 5.1.0
QT5 >= 5.2.0
QT5 support for: (Core, Widgets, PrintSupport)
KF5 support for: (CoreAddons, I18n, XmlGui, KIO, Sane)
libpng

You'll need both run-time and devel packages of the above in order to compile and run kEasySkan

Most distributions provide packages for them, so it won't be a problem.


OPTIONAL

gimp and ghostcript, if installed, shall provide full functionality to kEasySkan.

Chances are that they are already installed, as most distros include them as standard option. Anyhow, they're both great open source tools and you won't regret using them.
