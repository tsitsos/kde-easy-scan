 
This project is a skanlite fork designed to bring more functionalities to the user.
It is in beta stage so it may not work as expected.
However, it has been tested to compile and run on many recent GNU/Linux distributions running KDE-5 with no problems.
It may or may not work on other systems or on other desktop managers. You can try it and tell me.
